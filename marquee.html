Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance,<br>
 which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[1]).<br> 
 It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food, energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, <br>
 indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are <br>
 attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.[2] "Water" is also the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard temperature and pressure.<br>
