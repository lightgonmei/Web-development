        The Most In-Demand Programming Languages
1. JavaScript
What this language is used for: 

Web development
Game development
Mobile apps 
Building web servers
According to Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey, JavaScript currently stands as the most commonly-used<br> language in the world (69.7%), followed by HTML/CSS (62.4%), SQL (56.9%), Python (41.6%) and Java (38.4%). <BR>It is also the most sought-out programming language by hiring managers in the Americas (PDF, 2.4 MB). 

JavaScript is used to manage the behavior of web pages. With it, coders can create dynamic web elements <br> such as animated graphics, interactive maps, clickable buttons and more. Programmers who use HTML, CSS and JavaScript<br> in tandem obtain a higher level of website control and can provide a better user experience in terms of<br> navigation and readability. 

JavaScript is the most common coding language in use today around the world. This is for a good reason: <br> most web browsers utilize it and it’s one of the easiest languages to learn. JavaScript requires almost no prior coding knowledge <br> — once you start learning, you can practice and play with it immediately. 

Moreover, because the language is so ubiquitous, there are countless communities, courses and avenues of professional <br> support available online. This support, in addition to the language’s  <br>top-notch usability, makes JavaScript number one on our list of the most in-demand programming languages.  </p>

    <h3> <a name="History">  History </a>
        <p>
            HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. <br>Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.

HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers.<br> But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, <br>which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML,  <br>giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently <br>released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.
